      <p>As part of a university project, we were tasked with creating a key visual campaign for the iconic Air Force 1 shoe model. The primary focus of this campaign was to emphasize the aspect of individuality that this model represents. We aimed to convey that the Air Force 1 is suitable for both young and old, fitting seamlessly into all fashion styles.</p>
      <p>Given the keywords Marketing, Sports, Average, Superior, Middle Class, Worth, Quality, Fashionable, Sustainability, Expand, and Competitive, our challenge was to develop a campaign that captures the essence of these concepts.</p>
      <p>I aimed to show how the Air Force 1 suits people of all ages and fashion styles, making it a versatile and timeless shoe.</p>

    <p>As part of the project, the biggest challenge was to create the perfect mix of angles for the shoe and its surroundings. This was to ensure the shoe's proportions were shown correctly. Another important task was to define the different personas who would wear the shoe and to make sure our promotion was as diverse as possible.</p>

    <p>After several sketches, I conceptualized three worlds around the shoe: Artistic Individualist, Elegant Fashionista, and Lifestyle Youngster. In the first step, I showcased the shoe with different lighting scenarios to highlight its features and determine the layout for the visual.</p>
    <p>I began by setting up the shoe with various light sources to see how it would look under different conditions. This helped me choose the best angles and lighting for the final render. Once the lighting and layout were decided, I started building the elements around the shoe. Each element was carefully placed and adjusted to match the perspective of the render.</p>

    <p>What I enjoyed most about this project was seeing how simple sketches and ideas turned into a tangible, three-dimensional scene. It was particularly satisfying to experiment with different perspectives around the object during the creation process. This made it feel very much like a process of shaping and molding the final image. Engaging with the brand image was a valuable experience, as it refined my interpretation of the project and provided a clearer framework that ultimately aligned well with the final product.</p>
