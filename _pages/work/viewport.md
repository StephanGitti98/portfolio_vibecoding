      <p>This project was created as part of a university assignment, focusing on developing a conceptual remote office solution. The main objective was to visualize a technically feasible solution and ensure it is user-friendly for both employees and administrators. The final concept is presented as a product for a fictional company.</p>
      <p>Throughout the design process, I focused on creating an intuitive user interface that would enhance the overall user experience while also ensuring a cohesive brand image.</p>
      <p>For the product presentation, I additionally created animations to showcase the layout, functionality, and key benefits.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">The Inspiration for this project</h3>
    <p>The idea for this concept came from various factors affecting remote work at the time. The main focus was on the challenges small and medium-sized businesses face, such as technical setup, funding, and sustainable tech equipment. The project also looked into the potential of labor policies and how work and home life in cities could change.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">Breaking down the project</h3>
    <p>Using these factors, I created a brand concept with a defined logo, color palette, typography, and iconography. I then made wireframes for user and admin interfaces to map functionality and structure.</p>
    <p>For the company, I organized the application components into a clear instructional format. To enhance the presentation, I added animations and used animated illustrations to highlight key benefits and arguments.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">Personal aspiration</h3>
    <p>My personal goal was to design and code the website entirely by myself, without using any site builders. For embedding animations on the website, I utilized the Lottie framework. I created the animations in Adobe After Effects and prepared them for export using Lottie.</p>
