      <p>This project was created as part of a university assignment, focusing on designing a combination lamp and Bluetooth speaker. The main objective was to develop a product that seamlessly integrates into daily life, offering both audio and lighting solutions.</p>
      <p>In addition to its visual appeal, the product offers a versatile and user-friendly experience. The integrated lighting and audio features are designed to enhance the ambiance of any room, adapting to various moods and settings.</p>
      <p>For the product presentation, I developed detailed visualizations to showcase its design, functionality, and key benefits.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">The Inspiration for this project</h3>
    <p>The inspiration for this project came from noticing a lack of Bluetooth speakers that successfully combine aesthetics, lighting, and sound quality. Most existing speakers are either bulky or designed solely for outdoor use, lacking the elegance and multifunctionality needed for outdoor environments.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">Breaking down the project</h3>
    <p>For my project, I started by developing the basic shape and then forming the body of the speaker. Using a grid, I experimented with various shapes and selected my favorites to extrude and combine. It was important to me that the speaker was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I was most satisfied with a compact, elongated design that featured an oversized control knob for all functions and a handle with hidden lighting, illuminating both the control knob and the back of the handle. I created and modeled the final form in a CAD program to bring the design to life.</p>

    <h3 class="work-process-title">Showcase</h3>
    <p>To best showcase my concept, I highlighted the individual features and presented the speaker from various angles. I prepared the CAD model for Blender and created detailed renderings. It was important to me to use a consistent color scheme throughout the presentation to maintain visual harmony.</p>

    <p>The next step in this project is to develop an accompanying app that will enhance and complete the product experience. The app will integrate mood-based music and lighting effects, allowing users to customize their ambiance effortlessly. By syncing with the speaker, the app will provide a seamless and immersive audio-visual experience, further enriching the functionality and appeal of the product.</p>
